# üß† Personality Type Prediction using NLP  

This project aims to classify users into **16 MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator)** personality types (e.g., **INTJ, ENFP**) based on their social media text data. It leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques to understand personality patterns from linguistic behavior.

## üß© **Understanding MBTI Dichotomies**

The MBTI categorizes individuals based on four key dimensions:  

| Dichotomy | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Introversion (I)** vs **Extraversion (E)** | Focus of attention (inner world vs outer world) |
| **Sensing (S)** vs **Intuition (N)** | How information is perceived |
| **Thinking (T)** vs **Feeling (F)** | How decisions are made |
| **Judging (J)** vs **Perceiving (P)** | Approach to the external world |

Each person is classified into **one of 16 personality types**, based on the combination of these preferences.

## üß™ **Data Preprocessing Pipeline**

Steps followed to clean and prepare data for ML models:

1. **Text Cleaning:**  
   - Removed punctuation, stopwords, URLs, emojis, and non-alphabetic characters.  
2. **Tokenization:**  
   - Split posts into tokens using `NLTK` or `spaCy`.  
3. **Vectorization:**  
   - Applied **TF-IDF (Term Frequency‚ÄìInverse Document Frequency)** to convert text into numerical vectors.  
4. **Label Encoding:**  
   - Encoded 16 MBTI types as categorical labels for model training.  
5. **Train-Test Split:**  
   - Divided data (80% training / 20% testing).

## ü§ñ **Machine Learning Models Implemented**

| Model | Description | Key Strength |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| **Multinomial Naive Bayes** | Probabilistic model based on Bayes' theorem | Simple, fast, and works well with text data |
| **Random Forest** | Ensemble of decision trees | Reduces overfitting and increases stability |
| **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** | Finds the best hyperplane for classification | Effective in high-dimensional spaces |

‚úÖ **Model Training:**  
All models were trained on the preprocessed TF-IDF data. Hyperparameters were tuned using `GridSearchCV` for best accuracy.
